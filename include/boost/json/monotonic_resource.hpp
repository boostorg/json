/** A fast memory resource that never deallocates.
    
    A memory resource that allocates large fixed-size
    blocks of memory, with each allocated block being
    twice as large as the previous block.
    Allocated blocks are not freed until the memory
    resource is destroyed; calls to @ref do_deallocate
    have no effect. Memory will not be allocated unless
    @ref do_allocate is called and the current block
    does not have sufficent room to meet the request.
    @n

    An *initial buffer* can be optionally specified
    when constructing a `monotonic_resource`.
    If an initial buffer is provided, calls to
    @ref do_allocate will return storage within
    that buffer until it is filled to capacity,
    at which point subsequent blocks will be allocated
    using the default resource.

    In addition to this, an *initial size* can be
    passed to the constructor of `monotonic_resource`.
    The initial size determines the size of the first
    dynamically allocated block.
    @n

    This memory resource is useful for parsing without
    subsequent modification to the resulting @ref value.

        If the `monotonic_resource` has an initial buffer
        and its initial buffer has sufficent space to meet
        the request, the memory will be allocated within
        that buffer.

        Otherwise, if the current dynamically allocated block
        has sufficent room to meet the request, the memory will
        be allocated within that block. If there is no such block,
        or if the current block cannot meet the request, a new block
        will be allocated. The size of the new block will be twice
        as large as that of the current block, or `n` rounded up to
        the nearest power of two if `n` exceeds the size of the current
        block. The memory is then allocated within the new block.
