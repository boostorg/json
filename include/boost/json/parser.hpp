/** A DOM parser for serialized JSON.

    This class is used to incrementally parse JSON
    from character buffers into a @ref value container.

    @par Usage

    Before parsing a new JSON, the function @ref reset
    must be called, optionally passing the storage
    pointer to be used by the @ref value container into
    which the parsed results are stored. After the
    parse is started, call the @ref write function
    to provide buffers of characters of the JSON.
    When there are no more buffers, call @ref finish.
    The parse is complete when the function @ref is_complete
    returns `true`, or when a non-successful error
    code is returned.

    @par Incremental Parsing

    The parser allows the input to be presented in
    multiple character buffers. This is useful when
    not all of the serialized JSON is present at once
    and it is desirable to process the data as it becomes
    available, such as when reading from a network socket
    or other device. The incremental interface may also
    be used to bound the amount of work performed in each
    parsing cycle.

    @par Temporary Storage

    The parser may dynamically allocate temporary
    storage as needed to accommodate the nesting level
    of the JSON being parsed. Temporary storage is
    first obtained from an optional, caller-owned
    buffer specified upon construction. When that
    is exhausted, the next allocation uses the
    @ref memory_resource passed to the constructor; if
    no such argument is specified, the default memory
    resource is used instead. Temporary storage is
    freed only when the parser is destroyed, improving
    performance when the parser is reused to parse
    multiple JSONs.
\n
    It is important to note that the @ref memory_resource
    supplied upon construction is used for temporary
    storage only, and not for allocating the elements
    which make up the parsed value. That other memory
    resource is optionally supplied in each call
    to @ref reset.

    @par Non-Standard JSON

    The @ref parse_options structure optionally
    provided upon construction is used to customize
    some  parameters of the parser, including which
    non-standard JSON extensions should be allowed.
    A default-constructed parse options allows only
    standard JSON.

    @par Thread Safety

    Distinct instances may be accessed concurrently.
    Non-const member functions of a shared instance
    may not be called concurrently with any other
    member functions of that instance.

    @see
        @ref parse,
        @ref parse_options.

    /** Constructor.
        
        Construct a parser with these optionally
        specified parameters:

        @li The @ref memory_resource for the
        implementation to use when it needs to
        acquire temporary memory,

        @li The @ref parse_options to use, which
        can allow non-standard JSON extensions such
        as comments or trailing commas, and

        @li A caller-owned temporary buffer to use
        before allocating with the memory
        resource specified on construction.

        @par Example

        The following code constructs a parser which
        uses the default memory resource and a local
        buffer for temporary storage, and allows
        trailing commas to appear in the JSON:

        @code

        // this buffer will be used for temporary storage
        char temp[ 4096 ];

        // default constructed parse options allow strict JSON
        parse_options opt;

        // enable the trailing commas extension
        opt.allow_trailing_commas = true;

        // construct the parser
        parser p(
            storage_ptr(),  // use the default memory resource
            opt,
            temp, sizeof(temp) );

        // to begin parsing, reset must becalled
        p.reset();

        @endcode

        @par Complexity

        Constant.

        @par Exception Safety

        No-throw guarantee.

        @param sp A pointer to the @ref memory_resource
        for the implementation to use to acquire
        temporary storage.

        @param opt The options for the parser. If this
        parameter is omitted, a default constructed
        parse options is used, which allows only strict
        JSON and an implementation defined maximum depth.

        @param temp_buffer A pointer to valid memory
        which the implementation will use first to
        acquire temporary storage, or `nullptr` for
        the implementation to go directoy to the
        memory resource. If this parameter is left out
        the behavior is the same as if it were null.

        @param temp_size The size of the memory pointed
        to by `temp_buffer`. This parameter is ignored
        if `temp_buffer` is null.

        The supplied buffer does not need to contain the
        entire JSON. Subsequent calls can provide more
        serialized data, allowing JSON to be processed
        incrementally. The end of the serialized JSON
        is be indicated by calling @ref finish().
