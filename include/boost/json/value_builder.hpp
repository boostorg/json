/** A factory for building a value.

    A value builder implements an algorithm for
    efficiently constructing a @ref value from an
    external source (provided by the caller).
    It uses a dynamically allocated internal storage
    to hold portions of the document, allowing complete
    objects and arrays to be constructed using a single
    allocation when their contents are eventually known.
    This internal storage is reused when creating multiple
    values with the same builder. \n

    To use the builder construct it with an optionally
    specified memory resource to use for the internal
    storage. Then call @ref reset once before building
    each complete DOM, optionally specifying the
    memory resource to use for the resulting @ref value.
    Once the reset function is called, the value may
    be built iteratively by calling the appropriate
    insertion functions as desired. After construction
    is finished, the caller can take ownership of the
    resulting value by calling @ref release.

    @par Example

    The following code constructs a @ref value which
    when serialized produces a JSON object with three
    elements.

    @code
    value_builder vb;
    vb.reset();
    vb.begin_object();
    vb.insert_key("a");
    vb.insert_int64(1);
    vb.insert_key("b");
    vb.insert_null();
    vb.insert_key("c");
    vb.insert_string("hello");
    vb.end_object();
    assert( to_string(vb.release()) == "{\"a\":1,\"b\":null,\"c\":\"hello\"}" );
    @endcode
