/** A dynamically sized array of JSON values

    This is the type used to represent a JSON array as
    a modifiable container. The interface and performance
    characteristics are modeled after `std::vector<value>`.
\n
    Elements are stored contiguously, which means that
    they can be accessed not only through iterators, but
    also using offsets to regular pointers to elements. A
    pointer to an element of an @ref array may be passed to
    any function that expects a pointer to @ref value.
\n
    The storage of the array is handled automatically, being
    expanded and contracted as needed. Arrays usually occupy
    more space than array language constructs, because more
    memory is allocated to handle future growth. This way an
    array does not need to reallocate each time an element
    is inserted, but only when the additional memory is used
    up. The total amount of allocated memory can be queried
    using the @ref capacity function. Extra memory can be
    relinquished by calling @ref shrink_to_fit.
    \n

    Reallocations are usually costly operations in terms of
    performance. The @ref reserve function can be used to
    eliminate reallocations if the number of elements is
    known beforehand.
\n
    The complexity (efficiency) of common operations on
    arrays is as follows:

    @li Random access - constant *O(1)*.
    @li Insertion or removal of elements at the
        end - amortized constant *O(1)*.
    @li Insertion or removal of elements - linear in
        the distance to the end of the array *O(n)*.

    @par Allocators

    All elements stored in the container, and their
    children if any, will use the same memory resource
    that was used to construct the container.

    @par Thread Safety

    Non-const member functions may not be called
    concurrently with any other member functions.

    @par Satisfies the requirements of
        <em>Container</em>,
        <em>ContiguousContainer</em>,
        <em>ReversibleContainer</em>, and
        <em>SequenceContainer</em>.

/** Exchange the given values.

    Exchanges the contents of the array `lhs` with
    another array `rhs`. Ownership of the respective
    @ref memory_resource objects is not transferred.

    @li If `*lhs.storage() == *rhs.storage()`,
    ownership of the underlying memory is swapped in
    constant time, with no possibility of exceptions.
    All iterators and references remain valid.

    @li If `*lhs.storage() != *rhs.storage()`,
    the contents are logically swapped by making a copy,
    which can throw. In this case all iterators and
    references are invalidated.

    @par Preconditions

    `&lhs != &rhs`
        
    @par Complexity

    Constant or linear in `lhs.size() + rhs.size()`.

    @par Exception Safety

    Strong guarantee.
    Calls to `memory_resource::allocate` may throw.

    @par Effects
    @code
    lhs.swap( rhs );
    @endcode

    @param lhs The array to exchange.

    @param rhs The array to exchange.
