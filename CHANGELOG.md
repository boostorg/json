Boost 1.83.0

  failed, in which case `std::bad_alloc` is thrown.
* Serialization behavior can now be changed by `serialize_options`.
* Contextual conversions.
* Parser option for more precise number parsing.
* Support `parse_options` in stream `operator<<`.
* Parser option to allow `Infinity` and `NaN` JSON literals.
* Parser mode that only validates numbers rather than parsing them.
* Numbers with exponent larger than `INT_MAX` are accepted by the parser and
  treated as infinity.
* Fix `object` member functions that should provide strong guarantee.
* Fix ambiguity of `end` call when `boost/range.hpp` is included.
* Fix ASan failures.
* Fix error message for `error::size_mismatch`.
* Fix conversion into tuple with const elements.

Boost 1.82.0

* `boost::hash` support.
* Caller-provided serializer storage.
* `value_to` supports missing elements for `std::optional`.
* Fix parser suspend inside an escape character.
* Make sentinel() return a unique pointer.
* Documentation improvements.

Boost 1.81.0

* Conversion traits were redesigned.
* Removed `condition::assign_error`.
* Removed `generic_category` alias.
* `object::stable_erase`.
* Added error condition for generic library errors.
* Added `parse` overload for `std::istream`.
* `operator>>` for `value`.
* Null-like type conversion support (including `std::nullptr_t`).
* Non-throwing conversion from `value` to user types.
* `value_to/from` supports `std::optional` and `std::nullopt_t`.
* `value_to/from` supports `std::variant` and `std::monotype`.
* `value_to/from` supports supports described classes and enums.
* Rvalue ref-qualified accessors for `value`.
* Support for self-swap and self-move in `string`.
* Support for self-swap and self-move in `array`.
* Replaced C floating point constants with C++ equivalents.
* Documentation improvements.

Boost 1.80.0

* Add non-const `value::at` overloads.
* Add the ability to manually choose endianness of the platform.
* Add `string::subview()` overload.
* Fix segfault in `array::erase(it)`.
* Fix low performance of `serialize` on libc++.
* Fix ambiguous conversion to `std::string_view` on GCC 8.
* Fix parsing on big-endian platforms.
* Fix handling of comment after trailing comma.
* Minor documentation fixes.

Boost 1.79.0

* Standalone mode of the library is removed. Users who wish to
  continue using standalone JSON can switch to
  [the C++ Alliance fork](https://github.com/CPPAlliance/standalone-json.git).
* Add support for JSON Pointer.
* Add `std::error_code` overloads.
* Add `boost::source_location` to `error_codes`.
* Naturally grow string during serialization.

Boost 1.78.0
* Standalone mode of the library is deprecated.
* Allow external libraries to forward declare `value_to` and `value_from`.
* Fixed signed integer overflow in number parsing.
* Documentation fixes.
* Add support for `/Zc:implicitNoexcept-` on MSVC.

Boost 1.77.0:

*  Implicit conversion operator from `string` to `std::string_view`.
* `value_to` supports `TupleLike` types.
* `value_to` and `value_from` support `std::array` and similar types.
* `object` deallocates the correct size.
* Fixed crash when constructing `array` from a pair of iterators that form an
  empty range.
* `key_value_pair` allocates with the correct alignment.
* `std::hash` specializations for json types.

Boost 1.76.0:

* Refactored `value_from` implementation; user customizations are now always
  preferred over library-provided overloads.
* Fixed imprecise parsing for some floating point numbers.
* Fixed link errors in standalone mode, when used alongside Boost.
* Fix Boost.Build builds on GCC 4.8.
