[section Parsing]

Parsing is the process where a serialized JSON is validated
and decomposed into elements. The library provides these
functions and types to assist with parsing:

[table Parsing Functions and Types
[ [Name] [Description ]]
[
    [__parse__]
    [
        Parse a string containing a complete serialized JSON, and
        return a __value__.
    ]
][
    [__parser__]
    [
        A stateful DOM parser object which may be used to
        efficiently parse a series of JSONs incrementally,
        returning each result as a __value__.
    ]
][
    [__basic_parser__]
    [
        The SAX parser base class which may be derived from in order
        to implement custom strategies for representing the parsed
        JSON.
    ]
]]

The `parse` function provides a succinct interface for
converting a JSON to a __value__ in a single function call
that uses exceptions to indicate errors:

[snippet_parsing_1]

An overload is provided to receive an error code upon
failure instead of an exception:

[snippet_parsing_2]

The calls above will produce values that use the default
memory resource. Each parse function allows an additional parameter
specifying the memory resource to use. Here we start the parser with
a new instance of __monotonic_resource__ for the resulting value:

[snippet_parsing_3]

These free functions use a temporary __parser__ instance, which
allocates internal structures to assist with performance. If a
program needs to parse multiple JSONs sequentially, performance
can be improved by declaring the parser instance explicitly and
using the parser's buffer-oriented interface. This stateful
interface uses the functions
[link json.ref.boost__json__parser.write_some `write_some`] and
[link json.ref.boost__json__parser.write `write`]
to supply zero or more sequential character buffers
representing the JSON, while the function
[link json.ref.boost__json__parser.finish `finish`]
is used to inform the parser that an optional final character
buffer represents the end of the JSON. This example parses
a complete JSON using the stateful API:

[snippet_parsing_4]

Explicit parser instances may also be used to process serialized JSON
incrementally. In the code that follows the JSON is represented by
two consecutive buffers, and the overloads which return the error
code are used instead:

[snippet_parsing_5]

[h4 Allocators]

When
[link json.ref.boost__json__parser.start `start`]
is called with no arguments, the parser constructs the resulting
__value__ using the default memory resource. A __storage_pointer__
can also be passed to the function, and the resulting __value__ will
use the specified resource. This example uses a noncounted
`monotonic_resource` as the allocator:

[snippet_parsing_6]

[h4 SAX]

Users who wish to implement custom parsing strategies may declare
their own type derived from __basic_parser__, and implement the
required virtual functions representing the SAX event interface.
In this example we define the "null" parser, which does nothing
with the parsed results, to use in writing a function that
validates a string to determine if it is valid JSON:

[example_validate]
